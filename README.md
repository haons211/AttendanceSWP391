# Attendance System For Employee

This is a Attendance System For Employee developed using Java 17, Apache Tomcat, and MySQL. The key features of the system include employee attendance tracking (chấm công), roll call (điểm danh), and internal mail sending (gửi mail nội bộ). The system is developed using **Java Servlets** for backend processing and does not rely on Maven for dependency management. The project is built using **NetBeans 23**.
